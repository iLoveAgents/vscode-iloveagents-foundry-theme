# Contributing â€“ iLoveAgents AI Foundry Theme

Thanks for your interest in improving the theme! Small refinements compound into better focus.

## Philosophy

- Clarity over visual noise
- Semantic differentiation beats random color variety
- Long-session comfort matters
- Incremental, reversible changes preferred

## Quick Start

1. Fork & clone repository
2. Open in VS Code
3. Edit JSON under `themes/`
4. Use command: *Developer: Reload Window*
5. Inspect tokens: *Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes*
6. Open sample files (`sample-code.*`) to validate language breadth

## Color / Token Guidelines

| Concept | Intent | Typical Target |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Keywords / Control | Structure scanning | Azure blue |
| Functions | Discovery & flow anchor | Purple |
| Strings / Text Literals | Content emphasis without glare | Pink/magenta |
| Numbers / Constants | Cool neutrality | Teal-green |
| Success / Added | Positive / healthy | Teal |
| Errors / Critical | Immediate attention | Red |
| Comments | Context / non-primary | Muted cyan-gray |
